--Overview:
-For this assignment, we were to implement a binary search tree that is able to separate values from the tree, and sort the values, that may be repeated, from the key. Then, it will be counted by the recurrance of the word.

--Features
- Set- Add or update a pair in the BST.
- Find- Search for a key and its associated value
- Delete- Remove a key and its associated value
- Print In-Order- Display the BST contents in sorted order based on keys
- Find Minimum and Maximum- Find the smallest or largest key in the tree
- Save to- Save the contents to a file in sorted order
- Load from- Read words from a file

  --Files
  - node.h- Defines the Node class used by the BST
  - bst.h- Header file declaring the BST class
  - bst.cpp- Implementation of all BST methods
  - main.cpp- Menu driven program that handles input and output

  --How to run
  - Run make with the provided makefile or use the code: g++ -o bst main.cpp bst.cpp
  - Then run with ./bst
